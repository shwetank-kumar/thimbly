      13. PCI DSS Applicability and Requirement
    </p>
    Thimbly, to the extent it is a Service Provider (as that term is defined
    and/or used by the then-current Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security
    Standard v3.0), shall be responsible for the security of cardholder data,
    which may include primary account number (PAN), cardholder name, expiration
    date, and service code, it possesses or otherwise stores, processes, or

    consents, licenses and permits required for the operation of your
    business.<br />
    <p class="font-weight-bold d-flex justify-start mt-5">
      15. Indemnification
    </p>
    In the event a third party makes any demand or complaint, or commences any
    action or files any claim whatsoever (each, a “Claim”) in connection with
    your use of the Platform, including without limitation your activities to
    Promote and/or Deliver Physical Products, you shall defend, indemnify and
    hold harmless Thimbly, its related parties and affiliates, and its officers,
    directors, employees, representatives, agents, licensors, attorneys, heirs,
    successors, and assignees (each, a “Thimbly Party”; and collectively, the
    “Thimbly Parties”), from and against any and all damages, liabilities,
    claims or costs (including the costs of investigation, defense, litigation,
    and reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) (“Losses”) incurred by any Thimbly
    Party as a result of such Claim, regardless of whether such Losses are
    direct, incidental, consequential, punitive or statutory.<br />
    Upon receiving notice of a Claim for which Thimbly is entitled to
    indemnification by you, Thimbly shall provide you with written notification
    and the opportunity to assume sole control over the defense or settlement of
    the Claim and reasonable assistance to settle and/or defend the Claim at
    your sole expense; provided, however, that (i) any settlement which would
    impose a non-monetary obligation on and/or admission or finding of liability
    or wrongdoing by Thimbly will require Thimbly's prior written consent; (ii)
    the failure to provide timely notice, control, or assistance shall not
    relieve you of your indemnification obligations; and (iii) Thimbly may have
    its own counsel present at and participating in all proceedings or
    negotiations relating to a Claim, at Thimbly's own expense, unless you fail
    or refuse to secure legal counsel to defend any Claim in a timely manner, in
    which case you shall pay all expenses related to Thimbly's use of such
    counsel.<br />
    In the event that Thimbly incurs costs, attorneys' fees or other expenses
    responding to any complaint other than a Claim, in connection with or in
    relation to your Physical Products (or your activities to Promote and/or
    Deliver thereto), including copyright infringement complaints under the DMCA
    (see below), Thimbly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to recover
    such costs and expenses by deducting a reasonable, commensurate amount from
    any monies owed to you by Thimbly up to a maximum of ten thousand dollars
    ($10,000) per event. In the event that Thimbly incurs any Losses relating to
    your violation of Section 9 (Marketing Restrictions) above, Thimbly reserves
    the right, in its sole discretion, first to recover such Losses by deducting
    a reasonable, commensurate amount from any monies owed to you by Thimbly up
    to a maximum of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) per event. You understand
    and agree that the remedies set forth above are not exhaustive and that
    Thimbly retains all rights to indemnification described herein. You
    authorize Thimbly to make, and release Thimbly from any liability in
    connection with, any such deductions.<br />
    <p class="font-weight-bold d-flex justify-start mt-5">
      16. Limitation of Liability
    </p>
    In no event shall any Thimbly party, or its heirs, successors and assigns,
    be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or consequential
    damages whatsoever arising out of, resulting from, or in connection with
    this agreement and/or any (a) use of or inability to use the platform, (b)
    personal injury, property damage, or losses of any kind, resulting from your
    access to and/or use of the platform, (c) unauthorized access to or use of
    any and all personal information and/or financial information stored
    therein, (d) interruption or cessation of transmission to or from the
    platform, and/or (e) bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or the like, which may be
    transmitted to or through the platform, whether or not Thimbly is advised of
    the possibility of such damages. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
    contrary, the maximum cumulative and aggregate liability of Thimbly for all
    costs, losses or damages from claims arising under or related in any way to
    this agreement, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, shall not exceed an
    amount equal to the total amounts due and payable by Thimbly to you under
    this agreement for the month immediately preceding the date upon which such
    damages accrue. The limitation of liability herein is a fundamental element
    of the basis of the bargain and reflects a fair allocation of risk. The
    platform, and any services or information offered through or in association
    with the platform, would not be provided without such limitations and you
    agree that the limitations of liability and disclaimers specified herein
    will survive and apply even if found to have failed of their essential
    purpose. Because some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation
    of certain categories of damages, in such jurisdictions, you agree that the
    liability of Thimbly shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by
    such jurisdiction.<br />
    <p class="font-weight-bold d-flex justify-start mt-5">
      17. No Guarantee of Validity
    </p>

    efficacy, timeliness, or correct sequencing of such information. Information
    provided on or through the Platform may or may not be current as of the date
    of your access, and Thimbly has no duty to update and maintain such
    information. Additionally, the information provided on or through the
    Platform may be changed periodically without prior notice. All content
    provided on or through the Platform is provided "AS IS." Use of such
    information is voluntary, and reliance on it should only be undertaken after
    an independent review of its accuracy, completeness, efficacy, and
    timeliness. If you have a dispute with one or more users, including any
    users that has purchased items from you as a Buyer or any user from whom you
    have purchased a Physical Product, you release us (and our officers,
    directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees) from claims,
    demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature,
    known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such
    disputes.<br />
    YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF YOUR COMMUNICATIONS AND INTERACTIONS
    WITH OTHER USERS OF THE PLATFORM. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT Thimbly DOES NOT MAKE
    ANY ATTEMPT TO VERIFY THE STATEMENTS OF USERS OF THE PLATFORM.<br />
    If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code §1542,
    which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor
    does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of
    executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially
    affected his or her settlement with the debtor."<br />

    ERRORS IN THE PLATFORM WILL BE CORRECTED. ANY CONTENT DOWNLOADED FROM OR

    <p class="font-weight-bold d-flex justify-start mt-5">19. Legal Disputes</p>
    If a dispute arises between you and Thimbly, our goal is to provide you with
    a neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute quickly.
    Accordingly, you and Thimbly agree that we will resolve any claim or
    controversy at law or equity that arises out of this Agreement or our
    services in accordance with one of the subsections below or as we and you
    otherwise agree in writing. Before resorting to these alternatives, we
    strongly encourage you to first contact us directly by email at
    support@thimbly.io to seek a resolution. We will consider reasonable
    requests to resolve the dispute through alternative dispute resolution
    procedures, such as mediation or arbitration, as alternatives to
    litigation.<br />
    This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of
    California as they apply to agreements entered into and to be performed
    entirely within California between California residents, without regard to
    conflict of law provisions. You agree that any claim or dispute you may have
    against Thimbly must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court
    located in San Francisco County, California, except as otherwise agreed by
    the parties or as described in the Arbitration Option paragraph below. You
    agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within
    San Francisco County, California for the purpose of litigating all such
    claims or disputes.<br />
    For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief)
    where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000, the party
    requesting relief may elect to resolve the dispute in a cost- effective
    manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. In the event a
    party elects arbitration, they shall initiate such arbitration through an
    established alternative dispute resolution (“ADR”) provider mutually agreed
    upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the
    following rules: (i) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online
    and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be
    chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (ii) the arbitration shall
    not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless
    otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (iii) any judgment on the
    award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
    jurisdiction.<br />
    All claims you bring against Thimbly must be resolved in accordance with
    this Legal Disputes Section. All claims filed or brought contrary to the
    Legal Disputes Section shall be considered improperly filed. Should you file
    a claim contrary to the Legal Disputes Section, Thimbly may recover
    attorneys' fees and costs up to $1,000, provided that Thimbly has notified
    you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you have failed to
    promptly withdraw the claim.
