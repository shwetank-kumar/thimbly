    We may collect information about buyers from or on behalf of our sellers. The sellers determine the scope of the
    information we collect on their behalf, that they transfer to us, or that we otherwise collect, and the information

    <br /><br />
    <p class="font-weight-bold">● Information Automatically Collected.</p>
    When you access the Site, we, our service providers, and our business partners may automatically log information
    about you, your computer or mobile device, and activity on our Site. The information that may be collected
    automatically includes your computer or mobile device operating system type and version number, manufacturer and
    model, device identifier (such as the Google Advertising ID or Apple ID for Advertising), browser type, screen
    resolution, IP address, the website you visited before browsing to our Site, general location information such as
    city, state or geographic area; and information about your use of and actions on our Sites, such as pages you
    viewed, how long you spent on a page, navigation paths between pages, information about your activity on a page,
    access times, and length of access. Our service providers and business partners may collect this type of information
    over time and across third-party websites. This information is collected using cookies and similar technologies.
    Please refer to the Cookies and Similar Technologies section for more details.

    <br /><br />
    <p class="font-weight-bold">● Social Media Networks and other Third Party Platforms.</p>
    We may offer single sign-on services that allow you to use third party login credentials to sign into Service. With
    your permission, Thimbly may also collect profile information contained in your third-party profile. Thimbly may
    also, for your use, enable you to import information about who you are connected to, as well as enable you to share
    information with those third-party sites. If you wish to discontinue such sharing, please refer to the settings on
    the third-party service or your preference page on Thimbly.
    We may also maintain pages for our company and our products on a variety of third-party platforms, such as Facebook,
    Twitter, Google+, YouTube, Instagram, and other social networking services. When you interact with our pages on
    those third-party platforms, the third-party’s privacy policy will govern your interactions on the relevant
    platform. If the third party platform provides us with information about our pages on those platforms or your
    interactions with them, we will treat that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

    <br /><br />
    <p class="font-weight-bold">● Sensitive Personal Information.</p>
    We ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive personal information (e.g., social security
    numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health,
    biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background or trade union membership) on the Sites, or otherwise to
    us.
    If you send or disclose any sensitive personal information to us when you use the Services, you must consent to our
    processing and use of such sensitive personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not
    consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal information, you must not submit such sensitive
    personal information through our Sites.

    <p class="font-weight-bold d-flex justify-start">3. Cookies and Similar Technologies</p>
    <p class="font-weight-bold">What are cookies?</p>
    Cookies are small data files stored on your computer or mobile device by a website. Our Sites may use both session
    cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile
    device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site.
    We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile
    device, which we use to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Sites; and (2) third party
    cookies, which are served by service providers or business partners on our Sites, and can be used by such service
    providers or business partners to recognise your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites.
    <br />
    <br />
    <p class="font-weight-bold">Cookies we use</p>
    Our Site uses the following types of cookies for the purposes set out below:
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ Essential Cookies - These cookies are essential to provide you with services
    available through our Site and to enable you to use some of its features. Without these cookies, the services that
    you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those services.
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ Functionality Cookies - These cookies allow our Sites to remember choices you make
    when you use our Sites. The purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid
    you having to re-select your preferences every time you visit our Site.
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ Analytics and Performance Cookies - These cookies collect information about traffic
    to our Sites and about how individuals use our Sites. The information gathered may include the types of information
    described above in the section titled “Information automatically collected.” We use this information to help operate
    our Site more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information, monitor the level of activity on our Site, and
    improve the Site. We use Google Analytics for this purpose. You can find out more information about Google Analytics
    cookies here: https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies, and about how Google
    protects your data here: www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html. You can prevent the use of Google Analytics
    relating to your use of our Site by downloading and installing the browser plugin available here:
    tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB. You can find out more about New Relic’s services here:
    https://newrelic.com/, and its privacy practices here: https://newrelic.com/termsandconditions/privacy.
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ Social Media Cookies - These cookies are used when you share information using a
    social media sharing button on our Site or you link your account or engage with our content on or through a social
    networking website such as Facebook or Twitter. The social network will record that you have done this. Social
    networks use their own cookies.
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ Targeted and advertising cookies - These cookies track your browsing habits to
    enable us and third-party advertising networks to deliver ads that may be of interest to you. These cookies use
    information about your browsing history to group you with other users who have similar interests or browsing
    behavior. Based on the cookies that the third-party advertising network sets on our Site and other sites,
    advertisers can display advertisements that may be relevant to your interests on our Site and while you are on third
    party websites. You can choose to disable cookies, as described below, or to opt out of the use of your browsing
    behaviour for purposes of targeted advertising. For opt out instructions, please review the “Targeted online
    advertising” portion of the “Your Choices” section of this Privacy Policy."
    <br />
    <br />
    <p class="font-weight-bold">Disabling cookies</p>
    You can typically remove or reject cookies via your browser settings. In order to do this, follow the instructions
    provided by your browser (usually located within the “settings,” “help” “tools” or “edit” menus). Many browsers are
    set to accept cookies until you change your settings.
    For further information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your computer or mobile
    device and how to manage and delete them, visit www.allaboutcookies.org.
    If you do not accept our cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of our Site. For example, we may
    not be able to recognize your computer or mobile device and you may need to log in every time you visit our Site.
    <br />
    <br />
    <p class="font-weight-bold">Other technologies</p>
    In addition to cookies, our Sites may use other technologies, such as Flash technology, pixel tags, and software
    development kits (or SDKs) to collect information automatically.
    <br />
    <br />
    <p class="font-weight-bold">Flash Technology</p>
    We may use Flash cookies (which are also known as Flash Local Shared Object (“LSOs”)) on our Site to collect and
    store information about your use of our Site. Unlike other cookies, Flash cookies cannot be removed or rejected via
    your browser settings. If you do not want Flash cookies stored on your computer or mobile device, you can adjust the
    settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings
    Panel at this website. You can also control Flash LSOs by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel at this website
    and following the instructions. Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash
    LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications
    used in connection with our Site.
    Pixel tags
    We may also use pixel tags (which are also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) on our Site and in our HTML
    formatted emails to track the actions of users on our Site and interactions with our emails. Unlike cookies, which
    are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on
    webpages or within HTML formatted emails. Pixel tags are used to demonstrate that a webpage was accessed or that
    certain content was viewed, typically to measure the success of our marketing campaigns or engagement with our
    emails and to compile statistics about usage of the Site, so that we can manage our content more effectively.
    <br />

    Use of Personal Data About Buyers on Behalf of Our Sellers.
    We use personal information we collect about buyers from or on behalf of our sellers to provide services only as
    directed or authorized by the seller. We do not use this information for our own purposes. Typically, our clients
    direct or authorize us to use personal information collected on their behalf to enable ecommerce and payments
    functionality on our clients’ websites, to manage the delivery of electronic goods, and to deliver communications
    from the sellers to their buyers.
    <br /><br />
    <p class="font-weight-bold">●To comply with law.</p>

    govern the Sites; (b) protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of you or others; and (c)

    send you certain marketing messages. If we request your consent to use your personal information, you have the right
    to withdraw your consent any time in the manner indicated when we requested the consent or by contacting us. If you
    have consented to receive marketing communications from our third party partners, you may withdraw your consent by
    contacting those partners directly.
    <br /><br />
    <p class="font-weight-bold">●To create anonymous data.</p>
    We may create Anonymous Data records from Personal Data by excluding information that make the data personally
    identifiable to you. We use this Anonymous Data to analyze request and usage patterns so that we may enhance the
    content of our Service and improve site navigation. We reserve the right to use Anonymous Data for any purpose and
    disclose Anonymous Data to third parties in our sole discretion.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <p class="font-weight-bold d-flex justify-start">5. Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data</p>
    We may disclose Personal Data to respond to legal requirements, enforce our policies, respond to claims that a
    listing or other content violates the rights of others, or protect anyone's rights, property, or safety. Such
    information will be disclosed in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

    collection, affiliate and rewards programs).
    ○Our subsidiaries and corporate affiliates for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.
    ○Our sellers, when you make a purchase with them using our Services.
    ○Other third parties to whom you explicitly ask us to send your information (or about whom you are otherwise
    explicitly notified and consent to when using a specific service).
    ○A third party payments processor to process payments made to us. Currently, we use Paypal to process our payments.
    Paypal may use personal information it collects when processing our payments as directed by us and for certain
    additional purposes. The information that Paypal obtains in connection with processing our payments is subject to
    Paypal’s Privacy Policy.
    ○Professional advisors, such as lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers, where necessary in the course of the
    professional services that they render to us.
    ○Law enforcement, governmental agencies, or authorized third-parties, in response to a verified request relating to
    a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity or any other activity that may expose us, you, or any other
    Thimbly User to legal liability. In such events, we will disclose information relevant to the investigation, such as
    name, city, state, ZIP code, telephone number, e-mail address, User ID history, IP address, fraud complaints,
    bidding and listing history, and anything else we may deem relevant to the investigation.
    ○Other business entities with which we perform a business transaction (or potential business transaction), such as a
    merger, consolidation, or acquisition, in which case we will make reasonable efforts to require that the recipient
    follow this Privacy Policy with respect to your Personal Data. In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or
    receivership, your Personal Data may also be transferred as a business asset.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <p class="font-weight-bold d-flex justify-start">6. Account Protection</p>
    Your password is the key to your account. Use unique numbers, letters and special characters, and do not disclose
    your Thimbly password to anyone. If you do share your password or your Personal Data with others, remember that you
    are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account. If you lose control of your password, you may
    lose substantial control over your Personal Data and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf.
    Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately notify Thimbly and change
    your password.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <p class="font-weight-bold d-flex justify-start">7. Your Choices</p>
    Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Data
    You may change any of your Personal Data in your account by editing your profile within your account or by sending
    an e-mail to us at the e-mail address set forth below. You may request deletion of your Personal Data by us, but
    please note that we may be required to keep this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a
    certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such
    requirements). Upon your request, we will close your account and remove your Personal Data from view as soon as
    reasonably possible, based on your account activity and in accordance with applicable law. We do retain Personal
    Data from closed accounts to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot
    problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our User Agreement, and take other actions otherwise permitted by
    law.
    Marketing communications
    You may opt out of marketing-related emails by clicking on a link at the bottom of our marketing emails, or by
    contacting us at support@thimbly.io. You may continue to receive service-related and other non-marketing emails.
    Targeted online advertising
    Some of the business partners that collect information about users’ activities on our Sites may be members of
    organizations or programs that provide choices to individuals regarding the use of their browsing behavior or mobile
    application usage for purposes of targeted advertising.
    Users may opt out of receiving targeted advertising on websites through members of the Network Advertising
    Initiative by clicking here: www.networkadvertising.org/choices, or the Digital Advertising Alliance by clicking
    here: www.aboutads.info/choices. Please note that we also may work with companies that offer their own opt-out
    mechanisms and may not participate in the opt-out mechanisms that we linked above.
    If you choose to opt-out of targeted advertisements, you will still see advertisements online but they may not be
    relevant to you. Even if you do choose to opt out, not all companies that serve online behavioural advertising are
    included in this list, and so you may still receive some cookies and tailored advertisements from companies that are
    not listed.
    In addition, your mobile device settings may limit our, or our partners’, ability to engage in ad tracking or
    targeted advertising using the Google Advertising ID or Apple ID for Advertising associated with your mobile device.
    Do Not Track Signals
    Some Internet browsers may be configured to send "Do Not Track" signals to the online services that you visit. We
    currently do not currently respond to do not track signals. To find out more about "Do Not Track," please visit
    http://www.allaboutdnt.com.
    Choosing not to share your personal information
    Where we are required by law to collect your personal information, or where we need your personal information in
    order to provide our services to you, if you do not provide this information when requested (or you later ask to
    delete it), we may not be able to provide you with our services. We will tell you what information you must provide
    to receive the services by designating it as required in or on the Sites or through other appropriate means.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <p class="font-weight-bold d-flex justify-start">8. Security</p>
    Your information is stored on our servers located in the United States. We use a variety of security technologies
    and procedures to help protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. However, as you
    probably know, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other
    Users may abuse or misuse your Personal Data that they collect from the Site. Therefore, we do not promise, and you
    should not expect, that your Personal Data or private communications will always remain private.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <p class="font-weight-bold d-flex justify-start">9. International Transfers</p>
    Thimbly is headquartered in the United States and has service providers in other countries, and your personal
    information may be transferred to the United States or other locations outside of your state, province, country or
    other governmental jurisdiction where privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <p class="font-weight-bold d-flex justify-start">10. Third Parties</p>
    Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure
    of information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, whether they are bidders, buyers or
    sellers on our Site or other sites throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of
    the information you disclose to them. Thimbly does not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are
    subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. We encourage you to ask questions before
    you disclose your Personal Data to others.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <p class="font-weight-bold d-flex justify-start">11. Changes to this Privacy Policy</p>
    We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. We encourage you to periodically review this page
    for the latest information on our privacy practices. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will
    notify you by updating the date of this Privacy Policy and posting it on the Sites and in the app stores where our
    mobile applications are available for download. We may (and, where required by law, will) also provide notification
    of changes in another way that we believe is reasonably likely to reach you, such as via e-mail (if you have an
    account where we have your contact information) or another manner through the Sites.
    Any modifications to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon our posting of the new terms and/or upon
    implementation of the new changes on the Sites (or as otherwise indicated at the time of posting). In all cases,
    your continued use of the Sites after the posting of any modified Privacy Policy indicates your acceptance of the
    terms of the modified Privacy Policy.
